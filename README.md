### Notes / Issues:
- Masonry is not 100 well implemented, run out of time, but hopefully i can comback late to the project and fix it: https://github.com/desandro/masonry
- Did not used Vue as intended so pure jQuery for now with express, but maybe later. Componenents base are on the project because of this reason.
- Need ENV VARS for MLab, Twitter Key/Secret.
